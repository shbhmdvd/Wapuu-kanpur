Name :KAAPU BHAI
About: he is the official mascot named "Kaapu Bhai" for WordCamp Kanpur 2K17.

Kaapu Bhai has got his name from kanpur+wapuu,
He represents the life and culture of people here in Kanpur(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanpur),for which this wapuu was designed. Everything that this wapuu has is somehow an important part of our lives and i just tried to represent it in a funky way.
